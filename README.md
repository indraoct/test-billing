# Loan Billing Engine
For some purpose

## System Design for Loan Billing Engine

### 1. High-Level Architecture

The Loan Billing Engine is a service that handles loan management, including billing schedules, payments, outstanding balances, and delinquency tracking. The system can be split into several components:

 #### a. API Layer
    Handles incoming requests from clients and routes them to appropriate services.

 #### b. Service Layer
    Encapsulates the business logic for loan management, such as:
    - Generating loan schedules.
    - Tracking payments and calculating outstanding balances.
    - Checking delinquency status.

 #### c. Data Layer
    Manages data persistence in a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

 #### d. External Services

    Notification Service: Notifies borrowers of upcoming or missed payments.
    Analytics Service: Tracks loan performance metrics for internal use.

### 2. Components

 #### a. Loan Management Service
    Core service responsible for:
    - Creating loans.
    - Generating repayment schedules.
    - Handling payments.
    - Delinquency checks.

 #### b. Notification Service
    Stores all loan-related data:
    - Loan details (ID, principal, interest rate, etc.).
    - Repayment schedules and payment statuses.
    - Customer details.

 #### c. Database
    Stores all loan-related data:
    - Loan details (ID, principal, interest rate, etc.).
    - Repayment schedules and payment statuses.
    - Customer details.

 #### d. Frontend (Optional)
    Web or mobile UI for borrowers and admins to interact with the system.

### 3. Database Design
Hereâ€™s a relational schema for the database:

 #### Tables:

    Customers

    - id (Primary Key)
    - name
    - email
    - phone
    
    Loans
    
    - id (Primary Key)
    - customer_id (Foreign Key -> Customers)
    - principal_amount
    - interest_rate
    - weeks
    - weekly_payment
    - outstanding_balance
    - status (e.g., Active, Paid, Delinquent)
    
    RepaymentSchedules

    - id (Primary Key)
    - loan_id (Foreign Key -> Loans)
    - week_number
    - due_date
    - status (e.g., Paid, Unpaid)


    Payments
    
    - id (Primary Key)
    - loan_id (Foreign Key -> Loans)
    - week_number
    - amount
    - payment_date

### 4. API Endpoints
Here are the key endpoints:


|Endpoint|	Method|	Description
|:---:| :---: | :---: |
|/loans|	POST|	Create a new loan.
|/loans/{id} |	GET	| Get loan details, including schedule.
|/loans/{id}/outstanding | 	GET |	Get outstanding balance.
|/loans/{id}/delinquent	| GET |	Check if the borrower is delinquent.
|/loans/{id}/payments |	POST |	Make a payment for a loan.
| /customers/{id}	| GET	| Get customer details.


### 5. System Workflow
 #### a. Loan Creation

    - Admin calls /loans API with loan details.
    - Loan schedule is generated and stored in the RepaymentSchedules table.
    - Initial status is set to Active.

 #### b. Payment Processing

    - Borrower makes a payment via /loans/{id}/payments.
    - Payment is recorded in the Payments table.
    - Outstanding balance is recalculated.
    - Delinquency status is updated if applicable.

 #### c. Delinquency Tracking

    - A background job checks for loans with missed payments and marks them as delinquent if necessary.

 #### d. Notification

    - Notification service sends reminders for upcoming payments and delinquency warnings.

#### 6. Technology Stack (for this test i just code in backend)

 #### a. Backend

    - Language: Go (for performance and concurrency).
    - Framework: Echo for REST APIs.

 #### b. Database

    PostgreSQL: For relational data with transactional guarantees.

 #### c. Queueing System

    RabbitMQ/Kafka: For asynchronous communication between services (e.g., sending notifications).

 #### d. Frontend

    - React or Vue.js for web.
    - Flutter for mobile apps.

 #### e. Deployment

    - Docker & Kubernetes: For containerization and orchestration.
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for automated deployments.

 #### f. Monitoring

    - Prometheus & Grafana: For metrics and alerting.
    - ELK Stack: For centralized logging.
